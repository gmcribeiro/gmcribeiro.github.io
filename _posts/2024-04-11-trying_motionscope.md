# Meeting report

In this meeting, we used the MotionScope to see the problem: It is not possible to accurately see the mode of vibration. It is easy to get an optical illusion when we expect a certain mode of vibration, but in reality, it is another mode (For example, torsion and flexion).

An idea to solve this is to use the camera in two places and identify common points. Then get the 3D motion of the pixels and, for example, plot them in a way that is possible to change the point of view. It would also be interesting to wrap the points around a surface (like an STL) to get a better view.

Then we discussed a bit about what we are planning to do to solve our problems.

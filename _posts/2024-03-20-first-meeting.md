# Meeting report

I need to define better the problem description:

- Learn how the MotionScope works
- What is possible to do with the MotionScope, and what do we want to do that isn’t currently possible?

After a better understanding, I should talk again with prof. Rui Moreira, in order to adjust the “final” problem description and planning

Next LAR Meeting: 11/04/2024 (5, 10, or 15 minutes???)
